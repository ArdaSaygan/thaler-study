# Sum-Check Protocol Fork

This repository is a fork of the [Sum-Check Protocol](https://github.com/montekki/thaler-study/tree/master/sum-check-protocol) repository. The primary goal of this fork is to make the protocol non-interactive by applying the Fiat-Shamir heuristic. 

While the original repository includes a generic implementation of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, this fork is intended solely for educational purposes and to explore the non-interactive adaptation of the protocol.
